<p align="left">My name is Diego and I'm a third year Systems Engineering (direct translation from Spanish but it is like Computer Science) student @ Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in BOG. I was born and raised in EYP, CAS, CO, but I moved to BOG, CO almost 3 years ago. <br> "I know for a fact that I'm not the best, but I'm working my @zz off to be one of them."</p>

<p align="left">âœ¨ Creating bugs since April, 2005.<br>ðŸ“š I'm currently learning more about cloud concepts, financial derivatives and other finance concepts.<br>ðŸŽ¯ Goals: Get my engineering degree in 2026 by the age of 21. Enroll in an MBA at a top-tier university in the US. Become an entrepreneur in the near future. Get a Porsche 911 Turbo S. Begin a family. <br>ðŸŽ² Fun fact: I wanted to double major engineering with a finance degree (I couldn't do it due to scholarship issues ._.). I listen to the Minecraft soundtrack when I need to focus. I can remember phone numbers, credit card numbers and other combinatios with certain level of ease. Watch enthusiast on a budget.</p>
